# Force Deployment Status - Phase 1 Biological Engine

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYMENT INITIATED**

---

## ✅ Actions Completed

### 1. Project Anchor Verified
- ✅ Project root: `/Users/linkpellow/Desktop/my-lead-engine`
- ✅ `chimera-core/` subdirectory confirmed
- ✅ All core files present (stealth.py, validation.py, workers.py, main.py, generate_proto.sh)

### 2. Atomic Force-Push Executed
```bash
railway up --service scrapegoat-worker-swarm --path-as-root ./chimera-core
```

**Result:** ✅ **"Indexing... Uploading..."** - Build initiated (NOT skipped)

**Build Logs URL:** Available in Railway Dashboard

---

## 🔍 Biological Handshake Signatures (Monitoring)

### Expected Build Sequence:

1. **System-Level Fix:**
   ```
   Installing playwright-deps
   Installing chromium
   ```

2. **Code Presence:**
   ```
   DiffusionMouse movement initialized
   ```

3. **The Blocking Gate:**
   ```
   ✅ CreepJS Trust Score: 100.0% - HUMAN
   ✅ BLOCKING GATE PASSED - Worker swarm approved for deployment
   ```

---

## 📋 Current Status

**Deployment:** ✅ Initiated (not skipped)  
**Build:** In progress  
**Logs:** Monitoring for biological handshake signatures

**Next Check:** Waiting for build completion (~3-4 minutes) then verifying:
- ✅ `Installing playwright-deps` (system-level fix)
- ✅ `DiffusionMouse movement` (code presence)
- ✅ `✅ CreepJS Trust Score: 100.0% - HUMAN` (blocking gate)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Phase 1 is successful when:**
- ✅ Trust Score = **100.0% - HUMAN** (NOT None%)
- ✅ `Installing playwright-deps` appears in logs
- ✅ `DiffusionMouse movement` entries visible
- ✅ Blocking gate passes
- ✅ Worker continues (not blocked)

**If score < 100%:**
- ❌ Worker exits with code 1
- ❌ Full fingerprint dump logged
- ❌ Deployment blocked

---

## 📝 Next Steps

Once 100% score is confirmed:
- **Phase 2:** Database Persistence (PostgreSQL + psycopg2-binary)
- **Phase 3:** Isomorphic Intelligence (Self-Healing selectors)
- **Phase 4:** Visual Observability (Trace Viewer)

**Status:** ✅ **AWAITING BUILD COMPLETION & VERIFICATION**
